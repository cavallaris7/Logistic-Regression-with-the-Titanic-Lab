##Logistic-Regression-with-the-Titanic-Lab

Your job for this assignment is to create a logistic regression model to predict survival on the titanic.<br>


You may start by using my lecture this week, posted on github.  It's titled Week6Lecture.ipynb.<br>

If you recall, I used only age and sex in my model.   You may use any variable you wish in your model.<br>  

It's up to you to choose the best features.  Collaborating with your class, the Internet, etc is allowed and encouraged.<br>
Many of the variables are categorical and if you choose to use them you will need to be converted using 'one hot encoding.<br>
You must validate your model against a random 20% holdout, using the train_test_split function (or R equivalent).<br>
Submit your notebook or R code on git as usual, and turn in a link to the file.<br>
